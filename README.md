### Why HomeRSS?
HomeRSS is a fork of spaRSS which based on "Flym" RSS reader.
It uses the same license (GPLv3) and has quite the same behavior.

### Etuldan forked "Flym" he said Why he created this fork:

  spaRSS is a fork of Flym. It uses the same license (GPLv3) and has quite the same behavior. So why I created this fork ?
https://github.com/FredJul , the official maintainer and developer of Flym has decided to not maintain his app as much as before. (see https://github.com/FredJul/Flym/blob/master/README.md ).
However, as Flym is a great app, and I wanted to add some features (like the Authentication Cookie, see https://github.com/FredJul/Flym/pull/296 ), I decided, with the OK of FredJul to start the fork.
Everyone, included FredJul is free to contribute or to use the spaRSS code for his own app, if it's GPLv3 compliant.
So if he decided to re-start on his app, I'll be very happy to help him to push all the modifications included in spaRSS into Flym.
